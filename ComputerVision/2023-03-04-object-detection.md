- R-CNN: Region-based Convolutional Network method
- Use SPPnets (Spatial pyramid pooling networks) to speed up R-CNN
  - one forward pass for all proposals (R-CNN needs to run conv-op once for each proposal)

- RoI pooling layer
  - uses max pooling to convert the features inside any valid region of interest into a small feature map with a fixed spatial extent of H Ã— W
  - small feature maps are flattened to RoI feature vector
  - RoI feature vector is sent to bbox and cls FC layer branches

- Smooth L1 loss on bbox regression

$$\text{smooth}_{L_1}(x) = \left\{\begin{matrix} 0.5x^{2} & \text{if } |x|<1 \\|x|-0.5 &\text{otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.$$

- convolutional feature maps used by region-based detectors, can also be used for generating region proposals.

- Region Proposal Network (RPN) 
  - takes an image (of any size) as input
  - outputs a set of rectangular object proposals, each with an objectness score.
  - This feature is fed into two sibling fully-connected layers
    - a box-regression layer (reg)
    - a box-classification layer (cls).

## [RetinaNet (ICCV 2017): Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19kEO8wkKiBUzYEEHVTwDVBS3tcNGyNa2/view?usp=sharing)
- **Focal Loss** (weighted cross-entropy loss)
  - down-weight easy examples and thus focus training on hard negatives.
    $$ FL(p_t)=-\alpha(1-p_t)^{\gamma}\log(p_t) $$

- **Feature Pyramid Network Backbone**

    - augments a standard convolutional network with a top-down pathway and lateral connections
